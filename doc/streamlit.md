Streamlit's secrets management system provides a way to securely store sensitive data associated with your Streamlit apps. You can use secrets to manage anything you want to keep private, like API keys and database URIs.

Here's how you can use it:
- Open your app in Streamlit Cloud, and go to the app dashboard.
- Click on the Edit Secrets button in the top-right of the dashboard. This will open a text box.
- Enter your secrets in JSON format in the text box. For example, if your API key is my_api_key, you would enter: {"api_key": "my_api_key"}.
- Click on Save to save your secrets. They will now be securely stored and available to your app.

In your app, you can access these secrets from the st.secrets dictionary. For example, you could access the API key from the above example like so: st.secrets["api_key"].
Please note that secrets are encrypted and securely stored. They are also not included when you fork a repo. They are only decrypted and loaded into the app at runtime. So they are never revealed in logs, errors, or other outputs.
