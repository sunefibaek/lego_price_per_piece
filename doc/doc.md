If I ever get around to writing some documentation this will be the place to do it

The two environment variables BRICKLINK_APIKEY, BRICKLINK_USERHASH are expected to be set on the system. This can be done with python on in a shell.

```python
import os
os.environ['BRICKLINK_APIKEY'] = 'xyz'
os.environ['BRICKLINK_USERHASH'] = 'xyz' 
```
